    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This recipe describes how to build my nonna's banana bread, that she always used to make for the family on the weekends.</p>

    <p>I iterated it over the years, trying different ingredients and landed upon the process I'll proceed to explain.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Bananas</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>Vanilla extract</li>
        <li>Sugar</li>
        <li>Eggs</li>
        <li>Baking soda</li>
        <li>Flour</li>
        <li>Butter</li>
        <li><em>(Optional)</em> Walnuts</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol type="i">
        <li>Preheat oven to 175Â°C</li>
        <li>Grease a pudding pan</li>
        <li>In a bowl, mash bananas with a fork or potato masher</li>
        <li>Melt the butter in the microwave and add to the bowl</li>
        <li>Add the baking soda, salt, sugar, eggs, vanilla and mix thoroughly</li>
        <li>Add flour and mix. <strong>Warning:</strong> mix as little as possible to avoid developing the <em>gluten</em></li>
        <li><em>(Optional) </em>Add walnuts</li>
        <li>Put the mixture on the baking tray and cook in the oven from 50 minutes to an hour, until it passes the toothpick test.</li>
        <li>Take out of the oven and let cool for a few minutes before taking out of the mold, and then let cool completely on a wire rack before cutting and eating</li>
    </ol>

    <strong>Toothpick test</strong>: the bread is done if when inserting a toothpick in the middle, it comes out clean (without mixture getting stuck). It can also be done with a knife.
